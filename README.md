Research Question
Which individual performance metrics most accurately predict the likelihood of an NBA player winning the MVP award in a given season?

Description of Data
The data for this project was sourced from Basketball Reference, focusing on each seasonâ€™s MVP statistics since the award's inception. We initially scraped seasonal stats for MVP players to capture their performance metrics over time. To build the non-MVP portion, we included the top 50 scorers from each season from 2000 to 2023 to ensure we analyzed only players with a realistic chance of competing for the MVP title, distinguishing between elite and MVP-caliber "hyper-elite" players.
In preprocessing, we encountered missing data in earlier seasons when certain stats weren't tracked, specifically steals and blocks before 1979 and three-point percentages before 1974. We imputed missing values for steals and blocks using the average MVP stats and applied a 40% penalty to field goal percentages for early three-point percentages, reflecting the historical context when three-point shooting was less common.
To address the class imbalance between MVP and non-MVP entries, we removed identifying columns like player names and teams and used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic MVP entries. This resulted in a balanced dataset with 1178 MVP and 1178 non-MVP rows, including individual player metrics and a target label for MVP status (1 for MVP, 0 for non-MVP).
